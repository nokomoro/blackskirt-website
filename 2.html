        Created in March 1998, 
        the Advisory Board provides ongoing guidance to the W3C Team on issues of strategy, management, 
        legal matters, process, and conflict resolution. The Advisory Board manages the evolution of the Process Document.
        The elected Members of the Advisory Board participate as individual contributors 
        and not representatives of their organizations. Advisory Board participants use their best judgment 
        to find the best solutions for the Web, 
        not just for any particular network, technology, vendor, or user. Read more about the Advisory Boar
        d and its work.
